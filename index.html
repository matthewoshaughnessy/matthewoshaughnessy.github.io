<p>My roommate and I got <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Syma-S107-S107G-Helicopter-Gyro/dp/B00F4WMAAW/ref=pd_sim_t_5?ie=UTF8&refRID=1WRZ9T5VVNX9P34X3CEY">these $20 RC Helicopters</a>, which are a lot of fun to fly, but the RC controllers they shipped with are hard to use. Using an IR receiver and an Arduino-based logic analyzer, I determined the control signals for my helicopter and created a new controller with an accelerometer and gyroscope that uses tilt controls to fly the helicopter.</p>

<p>When my registration slot for Fall of my second year opened, every ECE class I had the prerequisites for was full. To prevent the same from happening the next semester (and, of course, avoid early morning sections), I made a command-line utility to monitor registration numbers and send me text alerts when sections opened up. My program features a custom logging utility and network analytics that export to MATLAB for visualization.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from <a href="http://mykal.free.fr/synthesis/detectrythm.pdf">this paper</a>, I wrote a program to decect and track the beat in music. For many overlapping frames in an input song, I applied a filterbank and for each frequency band, calculated the signal envelope by applying the Hilbert transform using a half-hanning window as a low-pass filter. Next, I applied a first-difference filter and rectified the result, giving me a signal that had large peaks at times where there was a large increase in sound energy. Finally, a comb filter was used to detect the tempo of the music. In the future, I would like to use linear prediction to prevent the algorithm from switching between the tempo and half/double the tempo.</p>

<p>Practice is the best way to learn to code, so we try to make as many practice exam questions available to students as possible. Previous versions of the practice question bank were difficult both for students to use and TAs to update and add questions to. The new question bank I created with a small group of other TAs allows students to interactively answer multiple choice and code tracing questions, and allows TAs to easily add and update questions with a built-in error flagging system. A MATLAB script automatically parses data from formatted exam questions and creates an HTML POST request to add them to the website.</p>

<p>With my undergraduate research group, I implemented neural networks classification of data from a multi-modal accessibility device. Individually, I implemented performance-intensive portions of the training algorithm in CUDA C++. Unfortunately, the data transfer time between the CPU and GPU resulted in execution times longer than purely-CPU execution times when tested with handwritten digit classification, but GPU implementation will be faster for data sets with larger data sample sizes.</p>

<p>With my undergraduate research group, I wrote a simulator for Apache Hadoop to allow estimation of MapReduce job times before execution. I was largely responsible for the design and implementation of the distributed storage component of the simulator, which allowed users to estimate execution times of different network topologies.</p>

<h3>
<a name="radar-project" class="anchor" href="#radar-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RADAR Project</h3>

<p>(ECE 4271 - Applications of DSP) Processed received RADAR data to determine the range, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) of multiple targets from a synthesized fast-time/slow-time matrix of a fighter jet.</p>

<h3>
<a name="speech-enhancement-project" class="anchor" href="#speech-enhancement-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Speech Enhancement Project</h3>

<p>(ECE 4271 - Applications of DSP) Used short-term Fourier analysis of microphone array data to determine the location of a speaker in a noisy room. After the location of the speaker was determined, MVDR Beamforming was used to enhance the speech signal. Linear prediction was used to verify formants of the original signal matched formants of the enhanced signal.</p>

<p>(ECE 4271 - Applications of DSP) The two-dimensional cross-correlation was used to track the movement of a patient's interventricular septum from B-mode ECG images.</p>

<h3>
<a name="seismic-oil-detection-project" class="anchor" href="#seismic-oil-detection-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Seismic Oil Detection Project</h3>

<p>(ECE 4271 - Applications of DSP) Spiking and predictive deconvolution were used to spike a wavelet to determine the impulse response of the earth. Prediction filters were used to remove echoing, and the depth of water, limestone, and oil layers in the earth were determined from the earth impulse response.</p>

<p>(ECE 3056 - Computer Architecture) I modified existing VHDL code for a single-stage MIPS processor to create a five-stage pipelined processor and added hardware for forwarding and pipeline flushing to handle branch and data hazards. Most of the work for the project involved debugging and testing at the waveform level, which I did with ModelSim.</p>
