<a name="welcome" class="anchor" href="#welcome"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome!</h1>

I'm a fourth-year Electrical Engineering student at Georgia Tech interested in signal processing and machine learning.

<br><br>

I'm a co-op at Georgia Tech Research Institute, where I work on realtime processing for airborne bathymetric lidar.  On campus, I'm involved with undergraduate research, the Georgia Tech Symphony Orchestra, and as an undergraduate teaching assistant.

<br><br>

Last summer, I had a great time working in the DSP Algorithms group at Boeing Satellite Systems in Los Angeles, CA.

<img src="images/bathy.jpg" height="300" align="center" alt="Test setup for the GTRI bathymetric lidar"><br><br>

My first semester at GTRI, I optimized and multithreaded the CPU portion of the processing code to allow real-time processing (my work was an instrumental part of making GTRI the first in the bathymetric lidar industry with real-time processing!)  I also did significant debugging to give us an operational demo, which gave me a great understanding of how the entire system worked.<br><br>
My second semester, I worked on C++ processing and data collection code for a hybrid lidar, which uses an infrared geiger-mode time of flight sensor to model the water surface and allow the system to correct for the refractive effect of waves.  I also got to design signal processing algorithms in MATLAB to analyze the data we collected from our testing, which was used in technical reports delivered to the project sponsors.<br><br>
My third semester, I worked on developing the hardware for a topographic version of our lidar system and created signal processing and computer vision algorithms in MATLAB for coordinate computation, fusing hyperspectral imagery to our lidar point cloud.
(Pictured: our lidar set up for testing!)<br><br>

<img src="images/optimization.png" height="300" align="center" alt="Visualization of binary comparisons and resulting cost function for optimization problem">

<p>Many localization approaches in machine learning (e.g., classical multidimensional scaling) recover the locations of objects in some space given a dissimilarity matrix--for example, recovering a map from a list of distances between cities.  My research deals with a variant of this problem where only <i>binary</i> comparisons between objects are known (there is evidence that many real-life applications, such as consumer preference, are much more accurate when only a binary choice between two objects is offered).  I've formulated the problem as a convex optimization problem and have developed optimization algorithms in MATLAB to solve it.  I've created simulations for the Georgia Tech high performance computing cluster to develop "rules of thumb" of parameter choices and quantify performance trade-offs between different optimization algorithms.  Using this, I am working on developing a recommendation system that can iteratively improve the accuracy of an embedding when presented with streaming comparisons (pictured: visualization of the binary comparisons used for reconstruction and the resulting optimization cost function).</p>

<a href="images/ors-dbn-poster.jpg"><img src="images/ors-dbn-poster.jpg" height="300" align="center" alt="Data fusion with Deep Belief Networks poster"></a>

<p>With my undergraduate research group, I implemented neural networks for classification and fusion of data from a multi-modal accessibility device. Individually, I implemented performance-intensive portions of the training algorithm in CUDA C++. Ultimately, the data transfer time between the CPU and GPU for our resulted in execution times longer than purely-CPU execution times when tested with relatively low-dimensional handwritten digit classification, but GPU implementation will result in performance gains for data sets with higher dimensionality (pictured: our poster that won 3rd place at the ORS research competition!)</p>

<p>With my undergraduate research group, I wrote a simulator for Apache Hadoop to allow estimation of MapReduce job times before execution. I was largely responsible for the design and implementation of the distributed storage component of the simulator, which allowed users to estimate execution times of different network topologies (pictured: our poster that won 2nd place at the ORS research competition!)</p>

<p>When my registration slot for Fall of my second year opened, every ECE class I had the prerequisites for was full. To prevent the same from happening the next semester (and, of course, avoid early morning sections), I made a command-line utility to monitor registration numbers and send me text alerts when sections opened up. My program features a custom logging utility and network analytics that export to MATLAB for visualization.</p>

<a href="https://github.com/matthewoshaughnessy/tempotracking"><img src="https://github.com/matthewoshaughnessy/tempotracking/blob/master/katyperryresults2.JPG?raw=true" alt="Sample Output"></a>

<p>Taking inspiration from <a href="http://mykal.free.fr/synthesis/detectrythm.pdf">this paper</a> and other sources, I wrote a program to decect and track the beat in music. For many overlapping frames in an input song, I applied a filterbank and for each frequency band, calculated the signal envelope by applying the Hilbert transform and using a half-hanning window as a low-pass filter. Next, I applied a first-difference filter and rectified the result, giving me a signal that had large peaks at times where there was a large increase in sound energy. Finally, I applied a comb filter and selected the frequency (tempo) with the greatest output energy. In the future, I'd like to implement a Kalman filter to avoid one-off errors where the comb filter detects half the actual tempo.</p>
