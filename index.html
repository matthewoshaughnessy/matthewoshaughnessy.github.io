<p>Quadrocopters are expensive to build, but with the salary from my co-op this semester I'll finally be able to build one. When I finish the basic quadrocoptor, I hope to experiment with image processing and computer vision via an on-board CMOS camera.</p>

Using an arduino programmed with C and AVR assembly and an IR LED, I created a new controller that uses tilt controls to fly the helicopter.</p>

<p>The only thing more competitive than classes at Georgia Tech is registering for those classes. I wrote this command-line program to automatically check the registration webpage and send me text message alerts when a seat in a class I need has opened up.</p>

<p>Practice is the best way to learn to code, so we try to make as many practice exam questions available to students as possible. Previous versions of the practice question bank were difficult for both students to use and TAs to update and add questions to. Our version allows students to interactively answer multiple choice and code tracing questions, and allows TAs to easily add and update questions with a built-in error flagging system. A MATLAB script automatically parses data from formatted exam questions and creates a POST request to add them to the website.</p>

<a name="neural-networks-for-accessibility-device-data-classification" class="anchor" href="#neural-networks-for-accessibility-device-data-classification"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Neural Networks for Accessibility Device Data Classification</h3>

<p>Implemented neural networks in MATLAB and Python (using NumPy and SciPy) for classification of data from a multi-modal accessibility device. Implemented performance-intensive portions of training algorithm in CUDA C++ and tested using handwritten digits from the MNIST database.</p>

<h3>
<a name="mapreduceapache-hadoop-simulator" class="anchor" href="#mapreduceapache-hadoop-simulator"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>MapReduce/Apache Hadoop Simulator</h3>

<p>Wrote a simulator for Apache Hadoop to allow estimation of MapReduce job times before execution. I was largely responsible for the design and implementation of the distributed storage component of the simulator.</p>

<h3>
<a name="radar-project" class="anchor" href="#radar-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RADAR Project</h3>

<p>(ECE 4271 - Applications of DSP) Processed received RADAR data to determine the range, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) of multiple targets from a synthesized fast-time/slow-time matrix of a fighter jet.</p>

<h3>
<a name="speech-enhancement-project" class="anchor" href="#speech-enhancement-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Speech Enhancement Project</h3>

<p>(ECE 4271 - Applications of DSP) Used short-term Fourier analysis of microphone array data to determine the location of a speaker in a noisy room. After the location of the speaker was determined, MVDR Beamforming was used to enhance the speech signal. Linear prediction was used to verify formants of the original signal matched formants of the enhanced signal.</p>

<h3>
<a name="echocardiogram-tracking-project" class="anchor" href="#echocardiogram-tracking-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Echocardiogram Tracking Project</h3>

<p>(ECE 4271 - Applications of DSP) The two-dimensional cross-correlation was used to track the movement of a patient's interventricular septum from B-mode ECG images.</p>

<h3>

<p>(ECE 4271 - Applications of DSP) Spiking and predictive deconvolution were used to spike a wavelet to determine the impulse response of the earth. Prediction filters were used to remove echoing, and the depth of water, limestone, and oil layers in the earth were determined from the earth impulse response.</p>

<a name="efficient-tile-puzzle-solver" class="anchor" href="#efficient-tile-puzzle-solver"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Efficient Tile Puzzle Solver</h3>

<p>(ECE 2035 - Hardware/Software Programming) Created a solver for a rotating tile puzzle in C and rewrote for efficiency in MIPS assembly. Graded on assembly performance by number of instructions stored and executed and storage/stack space used.</p>

<h3>
