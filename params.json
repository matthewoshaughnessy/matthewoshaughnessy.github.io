Using an arduino programmed with C and AVR assembly and an IR LED, I created a new controller that uses tilt controls to fly the helicopter.\r\n* Source and project details: [link](google.com)\r\n* Languages: C, AVR Assembly, MATLAB/Simulink (testing/debugging)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
